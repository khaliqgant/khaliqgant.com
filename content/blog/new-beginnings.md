After almost nine years at [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/) (formerly [vectormediagroup.com](https://www.vectormediagroup.com/))
I have decided to move on to a new challenge and join the team at [Overview](https://overview.ai/).

I first started at Happy Cog/Vector Media Group with limited development experience – fresh out of
a startup [Social Blendr](/tags/social-blendr/) and looking to get deeper
and broader experience in a [quickly growing](https://www.happycog.com/weve-made-the-inc-5000-list-for-the-9th-time/), fast paced development agency.
Looking back at my time I was able to do that and more. Over the past ~9 years
I've learned more and done more than I could have ever imagined. I have had
the honor in working on projects for some of the biggest and most interesting
companies in the world. The work was challenging, fun, dynamic, and always
interesting (btw Happy Cog is pretty much always [hiring](https://www.happycog.com/careers/)).

I'm super excited to join the extremely talented team at [Overview](https://overview.ai/)
to continue my growth and learn a ton. I'm also excited to go back to working at
a startup. The main difference this time around is that the company is actually [well funded](/blog/hustle-wont-solve-all-your-startups-problems/) 😃.
There are considerable technical challenges to solve at [Overview](https://overview.ai/) and I can't
wait to dive in and get my hands dirty 👨🏿‍💻.
